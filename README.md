Interactive Computer Systems assignment - Create a GUI using Java Swing that allows login for a user and allows them to create/view reviews. Reviews can have files/images (.png, .jpg) and it keeps track of the uploaded file and if its a supported image it displays the image icon. Profile picture for user account can also be changed and viewed from the profile and user can add topics (In an actual solution, it would auto create the user accounts and assign their topics automatically based)

Not very good, just uploading for future reference

It makes use of a SQLite database to store users and associated topics/reviews. Current version i believe works 99%, might be some errors but all panels/buttons should work.
